The plugin displays stock quotes in a table format with color-coding of gains/losses.

This plugin uses the IEX API for data. The use of IEX doesn't allow for Stock Indexes, Currency or non US markets, AFAIK. Adjust left and top in the style section in index.coffee if you want the plugin placed somewhere else on the screen.

2. The list of stocks is configurable
3. This plugin is modified based on the [stock-widget](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#stock-widget) plugin.
